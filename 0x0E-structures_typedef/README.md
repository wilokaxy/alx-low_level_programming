This task starts off the project with definition of a Structure about our Fav dog, Poppy.

1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself
this task initializes a variable of type struct dog

2.A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad
Write a function that prints a struct dog is what we do here

3. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read
define a new type dog_t as a new name for the struct dog

4. A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of
well this function creates a new dog, interesting

5. How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg
now we are freeing all dogs, they deserve it.

and there you have it, let`s go.
